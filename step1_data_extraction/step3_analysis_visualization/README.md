# Step 3 – Analysis & Visualization

This step analyzes and visualizes the processed irradiance and temperature data.

## Visualizations produced

### 1. Spatial heatmaps
- Heatmaps of:
  - GHI
  - BHI
  - DHI
  - BNI
- Plotted for selected **daytime timestamps**
- Nighttime values (irradiance = 0) are excluded to improve readability

### 2. Time-series analysis
- Hourly mean irradiance time series
- Hourly near-surface air temperature time series
- Temporal variability over July 2023 is analyzed

## Interpretation
- Spatial patterns reflect solar geometry and cloud conditions
- Temporal patterns show clear diurnal cycles
- Differences between irradiance components highlight atmospheric effects
