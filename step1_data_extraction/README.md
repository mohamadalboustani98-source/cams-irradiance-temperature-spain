# Step 1 – Data Extraction

This step describes how solar irradiance and temperature data were obtained
from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CAMS and ERA5).

## Data sources
- CAMS gridded solar radiation (GHI, BHI, DHI, BNI)
- ERA5 reanalysis (2 m air temperature)

## Geographic domain
Spain (bounding box):
- North: 41.82
- South: 41.72
- West: -2.56
- East: -2.4

Data were downloaded manually via the CDS web interface
and uploaded to Google Colab for processing.
